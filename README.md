This is an editor whose purpose is to allow you to view and edit any data in any form but in a shared environment.

This editor is based on a single node tree. Each node is attached to a specific javascript object, provides the ability to reactively interact with it, and binds additional data (metadata) to it ()  
This project uses its own system of generating html and css (GUI system), and its own system of events. No third party libraries. 

At the moment, it works correct only in Chrome browser
